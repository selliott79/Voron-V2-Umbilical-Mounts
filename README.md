# Voron-V2-Umbilical-Mounts
Umbilical mounting system for the V2 that doesn't require de-term/ re-term to install.

These mounts will allow the usage of a variety of multi conductor cables in an umbilical arrangement on the Voron V2.4. They mount to existing holes on parts so that changes
to parts on the base machine that are difficult to swap are eliminated.

I am personally using the below cable on my V2.4:
