# Voron-V2-Umbilical-Mounts
Umbilical mounting system for the V2 that doesn't require de-term/ re-term to install.

These mounts will allow the usage of a variety of multi conductor cables in an umbilical arrangement on the Voron V2.4. They mount to existing holes on parts so that changes
to parts on the base machine that are difficult to swap are eliminated.

I am personally using the below cable on my V2.4:

The mount has a dual clamp design with a zip-tie guide at the exit for a secure grip on the cable.

The mount is secured to the AB motor using 4 ea. M3 bolts that replace the stock screws on the motor. It is compatible with both the stepperoline model as well as the LDO.

The rear gantry mount secures to the holes used by the existing cable track cover. Simply remove and install the new part. The top cover has been thickened to prevent breakage.

The cable routing is designed to drop straight into the original path and be secured at the exit of the relief with a ziptie.
